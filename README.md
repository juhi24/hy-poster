How to use
----------

Any copyrighted material such as faculty logos are excluded from this template, and need to be retrieved by the user. Download your faculty logo from [Unigrafia material bank](http://unimaterialbank.unigrafia.fi/), preferably in eps format. It is recommended to autocrop the logo using `epstool` to get rid of the extra margin in the image:

    epstool --copy --bbox inputfile.eps outputfile.eps

There is also a space for the logo of your division/project/campaign.

Change `facultyColor` to match the color of your faculty.

You can easily set the desired size of the poster (a1 by default) and the number of columns (2 by default).

The author will be happy to answer any further questions about the use of the template.
